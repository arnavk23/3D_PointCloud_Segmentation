\chapter{Introduction}
This report details the process and results of performing semantic segmentation on 3D point clouds generated by the ZED 2i stereo camera, using the Point-Voxel Convolutional Neural Network (PVCNN) architecture. The experiments were conducted on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a resource-constrained edge computing platform, as part of the GeoAI4Cities research initiative.

\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Workflow Overview}
The following steps were taken to achieve semantic segmentation of ZED 2i point clouds using PVCNN on the Jetson Nano:

First, the official ZED docker image was downloaded from the Stereolabs GitHub repository. The docker was run on the Jetson Nano, providing a containerized environment for camera access and point cloud processing. Using the ZED	extunderscore Depth	extunderscore Viewer tool inside the docker, point clouds were captured and saved from the ZED 2i camera.

To interact with the camera docker remotely, TigerVNC was used to provide a graphical interface. This allowed for easy operation of the ZED tools and management of point cloud data. The complete PVCNN structure was then set up and executed within the docker environment. The trained PVCNN model was loaded, and the generated point cloud files were tested directly inside the docker.

The objective was to complete the following pipeline: generate point clouds using the ZED 2i camera, train the PVCNN model on the S3DIS dataset, run the generated point cloud files through the trained model using the saved checkpoints, segment the .ply files, and output the segmentation results as .txt files corresponding to each .ply input.

\section{Data Acquisition}
The ZED 2i stereo camera was used to capture high-resolution RGB-D data. The camera’s depth maps were converted into 3D point clouds, which were then preprocessed (normalization, augmentation, and semantic label mapping) for model input.

\end{figure}

\section{Model Selection}
PVCNN was chosen for its hybrid approach, combining the efficiency of voxel-based convolutions with the accuracy of point-based methods, making it suitable for edge deployment.

\section{Training}
The model was trained on the ShapeNet dataset and fine-tuned using real-world ZED 2i captures. Training was performed on a workstation with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, and the optimized model was deployed to the Jetson Nano.

    \label{tab:train_config}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        Parameter & Value \\
        \midrule
        Batch size & 16 (RTX 3070), 4 (Jetson Nano) \\
        Learning rate & 0.001 (cosine decay) \\
        Optimizer & AdamW \\
        Loss & Cross-entropy \\
        Epochs & 100 \\
        Data Augmentation & Rotation, scaling, noise \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Optimization}
To ensure real-time inference on the Jetson Nano, the model was quantized (FP16/INT8), pruned, and accelerated using TensorRT. Memory management and batch processing were optimized for the device’s 4GB RAM.

\section{Inference Pipeline}
The Jetson Nano processed live point clouds from the ZED 2i, running the PVCNN model to produce per-point semantic labels in real time.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Performance:} Achieved up to 8.9 FPS on the Jetson Nano, enabling near real-time semantic segmentation of live point clouds.

\chapter{Elaboration on Key Achievements}
\section{Real-Time Performance}
To achieve real-time performance, we optimized the PVCNN model using TensorRT and quantization techniques. The inference pipeline was streamlined for the Jetson Nano’s GPU, and batch processing was tuned to maximize throughput. Extensive profiling and iterative improvements enabled us to reach 8.9 FPS on live ZED 2i point clouds.

\section{Efficient Edge Deployment}
We selected PVCNN for its hybrid architecture, which balances computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy. The model was pruned and quantized to fit within the Jetson Nano’s 4GB memory, and all dependencies were cross-compiled for ARM architecture. This allowed us to deploy a state-of-the-art model on a low-power, affordable device.

\section{Accuracy}
Despite aggressive optimization, we maintained high segmentation accuracy by fine-tuning the model on both synthetic (ShapeNet) and real-world ZED 2i data. Data augmentation and careful hyperparameter selection helped preserve mIoU and overall accuracy.

\section{Robust Pipeline}
A robust pipeline was developed to handle data acquisition, preprocessing, inference, and visualization in real time. The system was tested in various lighting and environmental conditions to ensure reliability and stability.

\section{Resource Optimization}
Memory usage was reduced by over 40\% through model pruning, quantization, and efficient buffer management. This enabled the model to run smoothly on the Jetson Nano without memory overflows or slowdowns.

\chapter{Conclusion}
This work demonstrates that with careful model selection, optimization, and engineering, it is possible to deploy advanced 3D semantic segmentation solutions on resource-constrained edge devices. The combination of ZED 2i and PVCNN on the Jetson Nano opens new possibilities for real-time 3D perception in robotics, smart cities, and autonomous systems.
