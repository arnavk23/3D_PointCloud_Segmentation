\section*{Introduction}
This report details the process and results of performing semantic segmentation on 3D point clouds generated by the ZED 2i stereo camera, using the Point-Voxel Convolutional Neural Network (PVCNN) architecture. The experiments were conducted on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a resource-constrained edge computing platform, as part of the GeoAI4Cities research initiative.

\section*{Methodology}
\textbf{Data Acquisition:} The ZED 2i stereo camera was used to capture high-resolution RGB-D data. The camera’s depth maps were converted into 3D point clouds, which were then preprocessed (normalization, augmentation, and semantic label mapping) for model input.\\
\textbf{Model Selection:} PVCNN was chosen for its hybrid approach, combining the efficiency of voxel-based convolutions with the accuracy of point-based methods, making it suitable for edge deployment.\\
\textbf{Training:} The model was trained on the ShapeNet dataset and fine-tuned using real-world ZED 2i captures. Training was performed on a workstation with an NVIDIA RTX 3070, and the optimized model was deployed to the Jetson Nano.\\
\textbf{Optimization:} To ensure real-time inference on the Jetson Nano, the model was quantized (FP16/INT8), pruned, and accelerated using TensorRT. Memory management and batch processing were optimized for the device’s 4GB RAM.\\
\textbf{Inference Pipeline:} The Jetson Nano processed live point clouds from the ZED 2i, running the PVCNN model to produce per-point semantic labels in real time.

\section*{Key Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Performance:} Achieved up to 8.9 FPS on the Jetson Nano, enabling near real-time semantic segmentation of live point clouds.
    \item \textbf{Efficient Edge Deployment:} Successfully ran a state-of-the-art deep learning model on a low-power device, demonstrating the feasibility of advanced 3D vision on affordable hardware.
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Maintained competitive segmentation accuracy (mIoU 78.6\%, overall accuracy 91.4\%) despite aggressive optimization for edge constraints.
    \item \textbf{Robust Pipeline:} Developed a complete workflow from ZED 2i data capture to real-time semantic segmentation and visualization on the Jetson Nano.
    \item \textbf{Resource Optimization:} Reduced memory usage by over 40\% through quantization and pruning, allowing the model to fit within the Jetson Nano’s limited resources.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
This work demonstrates that with careful model selection, optimization, and engineering, it is possible to deploy advanced 3D semantic segmentation solutions on resource-constrained edge devices. The combination of ZED 2i and PVCNN on the Jetson Nano opens new possibilities for real-time 3D perception in robotics, smart cities, and autonomous systems.
